Title: WebGL2 Setup and Installation
Description: How to do WebGL development
TOC: Setup And Installation


Techincally you don't need anything other than a web browser to do WebGL
development. Go to [jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/greggman/8djzyjL3/) or [jsbin.com](https://jsbin.com)
or [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/greggman/pen/YGQjVV) and just start applying the lessons here.

On all of them you can reference external scripts by adding a `<script src="..."></script>`
tag pair if you want to use external scripts.

Still, there are limits. WebGL has stronger restrictions than Canvas2D for loading images
which means you can't easily access images from around the web for your WebGL work.
On top of that it's just faster to work with everything local.

Let's assume you want to run and edit the samples on this site. The first thing you should
 do is download the site. [You can download it here](https://github.com/gfxfundamentals/webgl2-fundamentals/tree/gh-pages).

Unzip the files into some folder.

## Using a small simple easy Web Server

Next up you should install a small web server. I know "web server" sounds scary but the truth is [web
servers are actually extremely simple](https://games.greggman.com/game/saving-and-loading-files-in-a-web-page/).

Here's a very simple one with an interface called [Servez](https://greggman.github.io/servez).

{{{image url="resources/servez.gif" }}}

Just point it at the folder where you unzipped the files, click "Start", then go to
in your browser [`http://localhost:8080/webgl/`]()`http://localhost:8080/webgl/) and choose
a sample.

If you prefer the command line, another way is to use [node.js](https://nodejs.org).
Download it, install it, then open a command prompt / console / terminal window. If you're on Windows the installer
will add a special "Node Command Prompt" so use that.

Then install the [`servez`](https://github.com/greggman/servez-cli) by typing

    npm -g install servez

If you're on OSX use

    sudo npm -g install servez

Once you've done that type

    servez path/to/folder/where/you/unzipped/files

It should print something like

{{{image url="resources/servez-response.png" }}}

Then in your browser go to [`http://localhost:8080/webgl/`](http://localhost:8080/webgl/).

If you don't specify a path then servez will server the current folder.

## Using your Browsers Developer Tools

Most browser have extensive developer tools built in.

{{{image url="resources/chrome-devtools.png" }}}

[Docs for Chrome's are here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/),
[Firefox's are here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools).

Learn how to use them. If nothing else always check the JavaScript console. If there is an issue it will often have
an error message. Read the error message closely and you should get a clue where the issue is.

## WebGL Lint

[Here](https://greggman.github.io/webgl-lint/) is a script to check for several
webgl errors. Just add this to your page before your other scripts

```
<script src="https://greggman.github.io/webgl-lint/webgl-lint.js"></script>
```

and your program will throw an exception if it gets a WebGL error and if you're lucky
print more info.

[You can also add names to your webgl resources](https://github.com/greggman/webgl-lint#naming-your-webgl-objects-buffers-textures-programs-etc)
(buffer, textures, shaders, programs, ...) so that when you get an error message it
will include the names of the resources relevant to the error.

## Extensions

There are various WebGL Inspectors. 
[Here's one for Chrome and Firefox](https://spector.babylonjs.com/).

{{{image url="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5bbc9caf2fc0ecc2eebf615fa8348146b37b08fe/68747470733a2f2f73706563746f72646f632e626162796c6f6e6a732e636f6d2f70696374757265732f7469746c652e706e67" }}}

Note: [READ THE DOCS](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Spector.js/blob/master/readme.md)!

The extension version of spector.js captures frames. What this is means is it only
works if your WebGL app successfully initializes itself and then renders in a
`requestAnimationFrame` loop. You click the "record" button and it captures
all the WebGL API calls for one "frame".

This means without some work it won't help you find issues during initialization.

To workaround that there are 2 methods.

1. Use it as a library, not as an extension. 

   See [the docs](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Spector.js/blob/master/readme.md). This way you can tell it "Capture the WebGL API commands now!"

2. Change your app so that it doesn't start until you click a button.

   This way you can go to the extension and pick "record" and then start your
   app. If your app doesn't animate then just add a few fake frames. Example:

```html
<button type="button">start</button>
<canvas id="canvas"></canvas>
```

```js
function main() {
  // Get A WebGL context
  /** @type {HTMLCanvasElement} */
  const canvas = document.querySelector("#canvas");
  const gl = canvas.getContext("webgl");
  if (!gl) {
    return;
  }

  const startElem = document.querySelector('button');
  startElem.addEventListener('click', start, {once: true});

  function start() {
    // run the initialization in rAF since spector only captures inside rAF events
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      // do all the initialization
      init(gl);
    });
    // make so more frames so spector has something to look at.
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {});
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {});
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {});
  }
}

main();
```

Now you can click "record" in the spector.js extension, then click "start" in your page
and spector will record your initialization.

Safari also has a similar built in feature that has [similar issues with similar workarounds](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62446483/debugging-in-webgl). 

When I use a helper like this I'll often click on a draw call, and check the uniforms. If I see a bunch of `NaN` (NaN = Not a Number) then I can usually track down the code that set that uniform and find the bug.

## Inspect the Code

Also always remember you can inspect the code. You can usually just pick view source

{{{image url="resources/view-source.gif" }}}

Even if you can't right click a page or if the source is in a separate file
you can always view the source in the devtools

## Get Started

Hopefully that helps you get started. [Now back to the lessons](index.html).

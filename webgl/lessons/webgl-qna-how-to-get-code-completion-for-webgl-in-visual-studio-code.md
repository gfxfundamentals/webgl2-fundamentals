## Question:

I have a school project and i need to use WEBGL. But its pretty difficult to write all the code without autocompletion. I didn't find proper extension. Do you have ideas?

## Answer:

In order for visual studio code to give you auto completion it needs to know the types of variables.

So for example if you have this

```
const gl = init();
```

VSCode has no idea what type the variable `gl` is so it can't auto complete. But you can tell it the type by adding a JSDOC style comment above it like this

```
/** @type {WebGLRenderingContext} */
const gl = init();
```

Now it will auto complete

The same is true for HTML elements. If you do this

```
const canvas = document.querySelector('#mycanvas');
```

VSCode has no idea what type of element that is but you can tell it

```
/** @type {HTMLCanvasElement} */
const canvas = document.querySelector('#mycanvas');
```

Now it will know it's an `HTMLCanvasElement`

And, because it knows it's an `HTMLCanvasElement` it knows that `.getContext('webgl')` returns a `WebGLRenderingContext` so it will automatically offer auto completion for the context as well

Note that if you're pass the canvas into some function then again, VSCode has no idea what that function returns. In otherwords

```
/** @type {HTMLCanvasElement} */
const canvas = document.querySelector('#mycanvas');
const gl = someLibraryInitWebGL(canvas);
```

You won't get completion anymore since VSCode as no idea what `someLibraryInitWebGL` returns so follow the rule at the top and tell it.

```
/** @type {HTMLCanvasElement} */
const canvas = document.querySelector('#mycanvas');

/** @type {WebGLRenderingContext} */
const gl = someLibraryInitWebGL(canvas);
```

You can see other JSDOC annotations [here](https://jsdoc.app/) if you want to document your own functions, for example their argument and return types.

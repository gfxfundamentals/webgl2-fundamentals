WebGL2 Fundamentals
===================

This is [a series of lessons or tutorials about WebGL2](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/).

Unlike most WebGL lessons these are not based off of OpenGL.
OpenGL is 20 years old. The lessons of OpenGL don't match well with WebGL.
The APIs have changed too much. The ideas of OpenGL and OpenGL tutorials
are out of date with WebGL, OpenGL ES 3.0 and the land of shaders.

I would argue that WebGL is actually a very simple API. What makes it
appear complicated is the way in which it's used. The complications
are added by the programmer. WebGL itself is simple.

These lessons try to show that simplicity and well as teach the
fundamentals of 2D math and 3D math so readers can hopefully
have an easier time writing their own WebGL programs and
understanding the complexity that other programmers pile on
top of simple WebGL.

This is work in progress. Feel free to contribute.

## Contributing

Of course bug fixes are always welcome.

If you'd like to write a new article please try to always take
one step at a time. Don't do 2 or more things in a single step.
Explain any new math in the simplest terms possible. Ideally
with diagrams where possible.

### Translating

Each translation goes in a folder under `webgl/lessons/<country-code>`.

Required files are

    langinfo.hanson
    index.md
    toc.html

#### `langinfo.hanson`

Defines various language specific options.
[Hanson](https://github.com/timjansen/hanson) is a JSON like format but allows comments.

Current fields are

    {
      // The language (will show up in the language selection menu)
      language: 'English',

      // Phrase that appears under examples
      defaultExampleCaption: "click here to open in a separate window",

      // Title that appears on each page
      title: 'WebGL Fundamentals',

      // Basic description that appears on each page
      description: 'Learn WebGL from the ground up. No magic',

      // Link to the language root.
      link: 'https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/ja',  // replace `ja` with country code

      // html that appears after the article and before the comments
      commentSectionHeader: '<div>Questions? <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/webgl">Ask on stackoverflow</a>.</div>\n        <div>Issue/Bug? <a href="https://github.com/greggman/webgl-fundamentals/issues">Create an issue on github</a>.</div>',

      // markdown that appears for untranslated articles
      missing: "Sorry this article has not been translated yet. [Translations Welcome](https://github.com/greggman/webgl-fundamentals)! üòÑ\n\n[Here's the original English article for now]({{{origLink}}}).",

      // the phrase "Table of Contents"
      toc: "Table of Contents",

      // translation of categories for table of contents
      categoryMapping: {
        'fundamentals': "Fundamentals",
        'image-processing': "Image Processing",
        'matrices': "2D translation, rotation, scale, matrix math",
        '3d': "3D",
        'lighting': "Lighting",
        'organization': "Structure and Organization",
        'geometry': "Geometry",
        'textures': "Textures",
        'rendertargets': "Rendering To A Texture",
        '2d': "2D",
        'text': "Text",
        'misc': "Misc",
        'reference': "Reference",
      },

    }

#### `index.md`

This is the template for the main page for each language.

#### `toc.html`

This is template for the table of contents for the language.
It is included on both the index and on each article. The only
parts not auto-generated are the links ending links which
you can translate if you want to.
The build system will create a placeholder for every English article for which there is no corresponding article in that language. It will be filled the `missing` message from above.

#### `lang.css`

This is included if and only if it exists. I'd strongly prefer not to have to
use it. In particular I don't want people to get into arguments about fonts
but basically it's a way to choose the fonts per language. You should set
the variables that are absolutely needed. Example

```css
/* lessons/ko/lang.css */

/* Only comment in overrides as absolutely necessary! */
:root {
  --article-font-family: "best font for korean article text";
  --headline-font-family: "best font for korean headlines";
  /* a block of code */
  /* --code-block-font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace; */
  /* a word in a sentence */
  /* --code-font-family: monospace; */
}
```

Notice 2 settings are not changed. It seems unlikely to me that code would
need a different font per language.

PS: While we're here, I love code fonts with ligatures but the seem like a bad
idea for a tutorial site because the ligatures hide the actual characters needed
so please don't ask for or use a ligature code font here.

#### Translation notes

The build process will make a placeholder html file for each article has an english .md file in
`webgl/lessons` but no corresponding .md file for the language. This is to make it easy to include
links in one article that links to another article but that other article has not yet been translated.
This way you don't have to go back and fix already translated articles. Just translate one article
at a time and leave the links as is. They'll link to placeholders until someone translates the missing
articles.

Articles have front matter at the top

```
Title: Localized Title of article
Description: Localized description of article (used in RSS and social media tags)
Cateogry: category for article **THIS STAYS IN ENGLISH**
TOC: Localized text for Table of Contents
```


**DO NOT CHANGE LINKS** : For example a link to a local resources might look like

    [text](link)

or

    <img src="somelink">

While you can add query parameters (see below) do not add "../" to try to make the link relative to the
.md file. Links should stay as though the article exists at the same location as the original English.

### UI localization

Some of the diagrams allow passing translations for the UI and other text.

For example if there is a slider named "rotation"
you can add "?ui-rotation=girar" at the end of the URL for the diagram. For 2 or more translations
separate them with a `&`. Certain characters are disallowed in URLs like `=`, `#`, `&` etc. For those
use their uri encoding.

For diagram labels you'll have to look inside the code. For example for the
directional lighting diagram near the start of the code it looks like this

```
const lang = {
  lightDir: opt.lightDir || "light direction",
  dot: opt.dot || "dot(reverseLightDirection,surfaceDirection) = ",
  surface1: opt.surface1 || "surface",
  surface2: opt.surface2 || "direction",
};
```

Which means you can localize the labels like this

```
{{{diagram url="resources/directional-lighting.html?lightDir=ÂÖâÁ∑öÊñπÂêë&surface1=„Ç™„Éñ„Ç∏„Çß„ÇØ„Éà&surface2=Ë°®Èù¢ÊñπÂêë&dot=dot(ÂÖâÁ∑öÂèçÂØæÊñπÂêë,Ë°®Èù¢ÊñπÂêë)%20%3D%20&ui-rotation=ËßíÂ∫¶" caption="ÊñπÂêë„ÇíÂõûËª¢„Åó„Å¶„Åø„Å¶" width="500" height="400"}}}
```

For testing reference the sample directly in your browser. For example

[`http://localhost:8080/webgl/lessons/resources/directional-lighting.html?lightDir=ÂÖâÁ∑öÊñπÂêë&surface1=„Ç™„Éñ„Ç∏„Çß„ÇØ„Éà&surface2=Ë°®Èù¢ÊñπÂêë&dot=dot(ÂÖâÁ∑öÂèçÂØæÊñπÂêë,Ë°®Èù¢ÊñπÂêë)%20%3D%20&ui-rotation=ËßíÂ∫¶`](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/resources/directional-lighting.html?lightDir=ÂÖâÁ∑öÊñπÂêë&surface1=„Ç™„Éñ„Ç∏„Çß„ÇØ„Éà&surface2=Ë°®Èù¢ÊñπÂêë&dot=dot(ÂÖâÁ∑öÂèçÂØæÊñπÂêë,Ë°®Èù¢ÊñπÂêë)%20%3D%20&ui-rotation=ËßíÂ∫¶)

### To build

The site is built into the `out` folder

Steps

    git clone https://github.com/gfxfundamentals/webgl2-fundamentals.git
    npm install
    npm run build
    npm start

now open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`

### Continuous build

You can run `npm run watch` after you've built to get continuous building.
Only the article .md files and files that are normally copied are supported.
